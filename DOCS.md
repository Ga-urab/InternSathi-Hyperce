To do app

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project is a to do app created as a task for Internsathi.
It uses Python(Django) and javascrip(ReactJS) as fundamental programming languages and frameworks. Within the given 48 hours this is what I have created. This allows user to carry out the basic CRUD operations. As per the requirement sqllite is used.

To run the programme first run the django server using command(python manage.py runserver) within the terminal of the django folder. Then run React server by using command(npm run dev). The application can be opened from React sever. Django server just works to connect the database.
